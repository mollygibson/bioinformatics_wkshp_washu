      "Your first script, [as with many first time programmers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%22Hello,_world!%22_program), will be a simple script that prints \"Hello, world!\". \n",

      "1. The first line of every python script is always <code>#!/usr/bin/env python</code>. This allows the python inerpreter to be invoked. Thefore, if `hello_world.py` was marked as executable, we could omit invoking the python interpreter manually:\n",

      "3. In Python 3, print is a function. In Python 2, print is a statement that prints everything on the same line to STDOUT. .So, in Python 3, we would need to write <code>print(\"Hello, world!\")</code> instead. To check the version of Python that you are currently running:\n",
