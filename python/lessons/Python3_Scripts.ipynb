      "In our first two Python lessons, we interacted with Python directly from the prompt (or the interpreter). Now, we will learn how to interact with Python in the way that you will most commonly interact: writing and executing scripts.\n",
      "\n",
      "Your first script, [as with many first time programmers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%22Hello,_world!%22_program), will be a simple script that prints \"Hello, world!\". \n",
      "\n",
      "First, create a file named `hello_world.py` with the following contents:\n",

      "\n",
      "1. The first line of every python script is always <code>#!/usr/bin/python3</code>. This allows the python inerpreter to be invoked. Thefore, if `hello_world.py` was marked as executable, we could omit invoking the python interpreter manually:\n",

      "        Hello, world!\n",

      "2. Python code is commented using the '#' character. Lines that start with '#' are ignored by the Python interpreter. We will talk more about this later.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. In Python 3, print is a function. In Python 2, print is a statement that prints everything on the same line to STDOUT. So, in Python 3, we would need to write <code>print(\"Hello, world!\")</code> instead. To check the version of Python that you are currently running:\n",
