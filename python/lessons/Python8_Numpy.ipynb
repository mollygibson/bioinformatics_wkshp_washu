      "## Why NumPy and SciPy?\n",
      "\n",
      "The basic operations used in scientific programming include arrays, matrices, integration, differential equation solvers, statistics, and much more. Python, by default, does not have any of these functionalities built in, except for some basic mathematical operations that can only deal with a variable and not an array or matrix. NumPy and SciPy are two powerful Python packages, however, that enable the language to be used efficiently for scientific purposes.\n",
      "\n",
      "[**NumPy**](http://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/) specializes in numerical processing through multi-dimensional **ndarrays**, where the arrays allow element-by-element operations. The arrays can be modified in size dynamically. This takes out the worries that usually mire quick programming in other languages. Rather than creating a new array when you want to get rid of certain elements, you can apply a mask to it.\n",
      "\n",
      "[**SciPy**](http://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy-0.14.0/reference/) is built on the NumPy array framework and takes scientific programming to a whole new level by supplying advanced mathematical functions like *integration, ordinary differential equation solvers, special functions, optimizations, and more*. \n",
      "\n",
      "#### These are very powerful packages, we will just scratch the surface!\n",
      "\n",
      "## Let's analyze some data\n",
      "\n",
      "We are going to use NumPy and SciPy to analyze data based on the famous 1885 study of Francis Galton exploring the relationship between the heights of children and the height of their parents. The variables are the height of the adult child in the first column and the midparent height in the second column, defined as the average of the height of the father and 1.08 times the height of the mother. The units are inches. The number of cases is 928, representing 928 children and their 205 parents. You can get it here:\n",

      "First, let's import the NumPy package. Often, NumPy is imported as `np`:\n",
      "\n",
      "    >>> import numpy as np\n",
      "    \n",
      "Next, let's import the data using the NumPy function **`loadtxt`** function from the NumPy package. The first parameter is the name of the file, the second parameter is specifying that we want to skip the first row or the header, and the last parameter specifies that the tab character (\\t) is what separates values on a row:\n",
      "\n",
      "    >>> galton = np.loadtxt(\"Galton.txt\", skiprows=1, delimiter=\"\\t\")\n",

      "To perform additional statistics on a NumPy ndarray, we will used the [**SciPy stats module**](http://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy-0.14.0/reference/stats.html), which is built upon the data structures from NumPy:\n",
      "    \n",
      "    >>> from scipy import stats\n",
      "    \n",
      "Often, you will want to be able to test if a set of data comes from a particular distribution before performing statistics. For example, many parametric statistical tests assume normality. We can test if the distribution of heights comes from a normal distribution using the SciPy stats module:\n",
      "\n",
      "    >>> stats.normaltest(galton)\n",
      "    (array([ 7.45230874,  0.4149256 ]), array([ 0.02408528,  0.81264347])):\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The SciPy function **`normaltest`** tests the null hypothesis that a sample comes from a normal distribution and returns two values for every test, the second of which is the p-value for the hypothesis test. Here, both p-values for the two different height distributions are >0.05 and we failed to reject the null hypothesis. We can, therefore, conclude that height comes from a normal distribution. \n",
      "\n",
      "What about if we want to calculate the correlation between child adult height and their parent's height? We can calculate the Pearson correlation between the child adult heights and the mid-parent height using a few different methods. From the NumPy package, we can use the function **`corrcoef()`** to calculate the Pearson correlation coefficient:\n",
      "\n",
      "    >>> np.corrcoef(galton, rowvar=0)\n",
      "    array([[ 1.        ,  0.45876237],\n",

      "           \n",
      "Here, we passed the `galton` NumPy ndarray and the the `rowvar` parameter to the function. The `rowvar` parameter was specified because the rows of `galdon` are not random variables, the columns are (remember column 1 is the children height random variable and column 2 is the parent height random variable).\n",
      "\n",
      "Let's take it a step further and use the SciPy stats module again to perform linear regression using the **`linregress()`** function:\n",

      "The most common parametric test to test if the mean gene expression is different between two independent groups is the **T-test**. We can perform this using the **ttest_ind** function from the SciPy stats module.

Remember, T-test is a parametric distribution that assumes normality. Before you perform the t-test, test if the gene expression for YFG comes from a normal distribution. Use the [normaltest](http://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy-0.14.0/reference/generated/scipy.stats.mstats.normaltest.html) function, like we did in the example. \n",
