      "## Why NumPy and SciPy?\n",
      "\n",
      "The basic operations used in scientific programming include arrays, matrices, integration, differential equation solvers, statistics, and much more. Python, by default, does not have any of these functionalities built in, except for some basic mathematical operations that can only deal with a variable and not an array or matrix. NumPy and SciPy are two powerful Python packages, however, that enable the language to be used efficiently for scientific purposes.\n",
      "\n",
      "**NumPy** specializes in numerical processing through multi-dimensional **ndarrays**, where the arrays allow element-by-element operations. The arrays can be modified in size dynamically. This takes out the worries that usually mire quick programming in other languages. Rather than creating a new array when you want to get rid of certain elements, you can apply a mask to it.\n",
      "\n",
      "**SciPy** is built on the NumPy array framework and takes scientific programming to a whole new level by supplying advanced mathematical functions like *integration, ordinary differential equation solvers, special functions, optimizations, and more*. \n",

      "#### These are very powerful packages, we will just scratch the surface!\n",

      "## Let's analyze some data\n",
      "\n",
      "We are going to use numpy and scipy to analyze data based on the famous 1885 study of Francis Galton exploring the relationship between the heights of children and the height of their parents. The variables are the height of the adult child in the first column and the midparent height in the second column, defined as the average of the height of the father and 1.08 times the height of the mother. The units are inches. The number of cases is 928, representing 928 children and their 205 parents. You can get it here:\n",

      "    \n",
      "Next, let's import the data using the `.loadtxt()` function from the NumPy package. The first paramter is the name of the file, the second parameter is specifying that we want to skip the first row or the header, and the last parameter specifies that the tab character (\\t) is what separates values on a row:\n",

      "What about if we want to calculate the correlation between child adult height and their parent's height? Let's calculate the Pearson correlation between the child adult heights and the mid-parent height.

Here, both p-values for the two different height distributions are >0.05 and we failed to reject the null hypothesis. We can, therefore, move forward with correlation calculation. For this, we will use the funciton `corrcoef()` from the NumPy package to calculate the Pearson correlation coefficient:\n",
