      "One way to write a program is to simply string together commands, like the ones described above, in a long\n",

      "to follow the logic of programs written in this style. Also, it does not allow you to reuse your code\n",
      "easily - for example, what if we wanted to analyze several different sets of heights for different sets of heights (e.g. men and women)?\n",
      "\n",
      "The most important ways to \"chunk\" code into more manageable pieces is to create **functions** and then\n",
      "to gather these functions into **modules**, and eventually **packages**. \n",
      "\n",
      "A function is a named piece of code, separate from all others. A function can take any number and type of input parameters and return any number and type of output results.\n",
      "\n",
      "We have used other functions before:\n",
      "\n",

      "1. Define it\n",
      "2. Call it\n",
      "\n",
      "### Defining Functions\n",
      "\n",
      "It is very easy to write your own function (**Again, indention matters!**). The syntax for defining a function is `def`, the function name, parentheses enclosing any input parameters to the function, and then finally, a colon (:). Function names have the same rules as variable names (they must start with a letter or _ and contain only letters, numbers, or _).\n",

      "        # Do something\n",

      "\n",
      "The first line contains with the Python keyword `def`, the name of the function (`function_name`), the sequence of input parameters (`parameter1`, `parameter2`, etc.) enclosed in `()` and ends in a `:`. The remaining lines form the **function body** and are indented by the same number of spaces.  The last statement contains with the Python keyword `return` and the variable to return when the function is called.  If the function doesn't return anything, just write `return` all by itself.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here's an example of a function definition:\n",
      "\n",
      "    >>> def multiply(x, y):\n",
      "    ...     return x*y\n",
      "    \n",
      "    >>> print(type(multiply))\n",
      "    >>> print(multiply(4, 3))\n",
      "\n",
      "Like we talked about earlier with good practices documenting code, it is useful to include a docstring to describe what your function does:\n",
      "\n",
      "    >>> def say_hello(time, people):\n",
      "    ...     '''\n",
      "    ...     Function says a greeting. Useful for engendering goodwill\n",
      "    ...     '''\n",
      "    ...     return 'Good ' + time + ', ' + people\n",
      "    \n",
      "**Docstrings**: A docstring (short for *documentation string*) is a special type of comment that tells you what a function does.  A docstring is a string that occurs as the first statement in a function definition.  It's good practice to enclose the docstring in **triple quotes**, e.g., `'''`.\n",
      "\n",
      "To print a function\u2019s docstring, call the Python `help()` function. :\n",

      "    \n",

      "## Namespaces and Scope\n",
      "\n",
      "**A name can refer to different things, depending on where it\u2019s used.** Python programs have various *namespaces*\u2014sections within which a particular name is unique and unrelated to the same name in other namespaces.\n",
      "\n",
      "Each function defines its own namespace. **If you define a variable called x in a main program and another variable called x in a function, they refer to different things.** But the walls can be breached: if you need to, you can access names in other namespaces in various ways.\n",
      "\n",
      "The main part of a program defines the global namespace; thus, the variables in that namespace are global variables.\n",
      "\n",
      "If a variable is defined inside a function, however, it is only present inside that function. For example:\n",
      "\n",
      "    >>> def assign_x():\n",
      "    ...     x = 4\n",
      "    ...     print(x)\n",
