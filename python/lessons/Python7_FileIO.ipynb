      "# Reading and Writing Files\n",
      "\n",
      "Often your data is much larger than a few numbers and is stored in csv (comma separated file) or a tsv (tab separated file). Using Python, you can read in data, analyze the data, and write the results to a file for use in the future or by another script. We will use the following tab delimited file for our example today:\n",
      "\n",
      "        wget http://genomic.wustl.edu/bioinformatics/python/lessons/hello.csv\n",
      "\n",
      "This file contains a hello in a few different languages and a greeting in that language, with the following format:\n",
      "\n",
      "        English,Hello\n",
      "        \n",
      "We will read this file in and write out to another file, one line for every line in the input file formatted in the following sentence:\n",
      "        \n",
      "        To our English speaking friends, we say Hello!\n",
      "\n",
      "### Input\n",
      "In order to read in data, the first thing that you must always do is open the file with **`open`**.\n",
      "\n",
      "        hellos_in = open(\"hello.csv\", 'r')\n",
      "\n",
      "This command opens the file named `hello.csv` for reading designated by the `r` and assigns it to the **file object** hellos_in.\n",
      "\n",
      "If I want to read the first line of the file, I can use the method for file object called **`readline()`**:\n",
      "\n",
      "        >>> print(hellos_in.readline())\n",
      "        \n",
      "If I want to read all of the lines in the file, I can use the method for the file object called **`readlines()`**:\n",
      "\n",
      "        >>> print(hellos_in.readlines())\n",
      "     \n",
      "A few things to notice here:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. `readlines()` returns every line in the file as a string stored in a list\n",
      "2. The first line that we read using `readline()` has already been read and won't be read again unless we explicitly tell it to do so\n",
      "3. There is a special character, called a **newline** or **return** character at the end of every line that was read in denoted by ``\\n``. This can be removed from a string using the method `rstrip()`, which removes special characters from the right side of strings. \n",
      "\n",
      "### Looping through a file\n",
      "Reading in the lines in a file is good, however, we often want to perform some analysis on each line, which can easily be performed using a `for loop`:\n",
      "    \n",
      "        >>> for line in open(\"hello.csv\", 'r'):\n",
      "        ...     print(line.rstrip())\n",
      "\n",
      "The variable `line` is of type string and takes on the value of a single line of the file looping through all lines in the file.\n",
      "\n",
      "We are now able to print each line in the file, however, we want to format the string for output. Ultimately, we have two strings that we are interested in from each line: the language and the greeting. As this is a .csv file, we know that these two values are always separated by a ','. In order to split the sting into each of these values, we can use the method **`split()`**:\n",
      "\n",
      "        line.split(',')\n",
      "        \n",
      "`split` is a method for the string object that takes the charactor or string of charactors that you would like to split the original string object on. So, for this example, we would like to split the string `line` by ','. Split then returns a list of all strings separated by that character. So, for example:\n",
      "\n",
      "        >>> for line in open(\"hello.csv\", 'r'):\n",
      "        ...     print(line.rstrip().split(','))\n",
      "        \n",
      "and since we know how to get the first and second elements in a list, we can now format the string like expected:\n",
      "    \n",
      "        >>> for line in open(\"hello.csv\", 'r'):\n",
      "        ...     split_line = line.rstrip().split(',')\n",
      "        ...     print(\"To our \" + split_line[0] + \" speaking friends, we say \" + split_line[1] + \"!\")\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "### Output\n",
      "\n",
      "We now must create an output file for writing:\n",
      "\n",
      "        hellos_out = open(\"formatted_hello.txt\", 'w')\n",
      "        \n",
      "Here, we are opening a file named `formatted_hello.txt` for writing (designated by the `w`) and assigning it to the file object `hellos_out`. Now, we can use the exact same piece of code that we already wrote, but instead of printing the formatted string to the screen, we will print to a file using the **`write`** method:\n",
      "\n",
      "        >>> for line in open(\"hello.csv\", 'r'):\n",
      "        ...     split_line = line.rstrip().split(',')\n",
      "        ...     hellos_out.write(\"To our \" + split_line[0] + \" friends, we say \" + split_line[1] + \"!\")\n",
      "\n",
      "When you're done writing to the file, use the **`close`** method to close the file object:\n",
      "\n",
      "        >>> hellos_out.close()\n",
      "\n",
      "After `hellos_out` is closed, you can no longer write to the file unless you open it again.\n",
      "\n",
      "From looking at the output file `formatted_hello.txt`, what do you notice is a major difference of `print()` and `write()`? How should we fix it?\n",
      "\n",
      "# You Try\n",
      "\n",
      "We would like to calculate the mean and variance for heights of male basketball players in the NBA and female basketball players in the WNBA:\n",
      "\n",
      "    wget http://genomic.wustl.edu/bioinformatics/python/lessons/basketball_player_heights.tsv\n",
      "    \n",
      "On each tab-separated line is either Male or Female in the first column, followed by an undetermined number of heights in inches of basketball players in the NBA or WNBA in 2013. \n",
      "\n",
      "Using [the module](https://cgs.wustl.edu/~mgibson/bioinformatics/python/lessons/heights_analysis.py) you wrote in the last exercise, write a script called `analyze_bball_heights.py` that it takes one command line argument that is the name of this file. Process each line of the file to analyze the mean and variance of the heights for that sport and output the results to a new file named `mean_athlete_heights.txt`.\n",
      "\n",
      "    $ python3 analyze_bball_heights.py basketball_player_heights.tsv\n",
      "\n",
      "To view the output file, use the linux command `cat` to print the contents of the file to the screen:\n",
      "\n",
      "    $ cat mean_athlete_heights.txt\n",
      "    The mean height of Male basketball players is 79.0653465347 with a variance of 11.9302451674\n",
      "    The mean height of Female basketball players is 72.3956834532 with a variance of 11.7625899281\n",
      "    \n",
      "Start with this script:\n",

      "    wget http://genomic.wustl.edu/bioinformatics/python/lessons/analyze_bball_heights.py\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "**Hints:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Remember the **escape character** for a tab is '\\t'\n",
      "2. Remember to remove the return character from each line before processing or analyzing that line\n",
      "3. When Python reads the file, it reads the text as a strings.  To convert the list of heights from strings to integers, use the code:\n",
      "\n",
      "        heights = list(map(int, heights))\n",
      "        \n",
      "4. To call a function from a module, use the dot syntax: `module_name`.`function_name()`\n",
      "5. Remember how to slice a list: list_name[n:m]\n",
