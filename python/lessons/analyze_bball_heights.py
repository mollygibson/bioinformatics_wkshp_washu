# This script takes in a tab-separated file that has heights
# corresponding to different groups defined by the first column
# and outputs the mean and variance of the heights for each group


# python imports
import sys

## TODO: import user defined module


## TODO: open an output file called mean_athlete_heights.txt for writing


## TODO: read in each line of the file from the command line, split
## the line on tabs, save the first item as the 'group' and the rest of 
## the list as height to calculate the mean and variance using the functions
## in the stats.py module. Print the mean and variance to the output file.
