      "The most common parametric test to test if the mean gene expression is different between two independent groups is the **T-test**. We can perform this using the **ttest_ind** function from the SciPy stats module. This test \"Calculates the T-test for the means of TWO INDEPENDENT samples of scores.\" You can look at the official documentation for this function [here](http://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy-0.14.0/reference/generated/scipy.stats.ttest_ind.html). \n",
      "\n",
      "You have RNA-seq expression data for your favorite gene, YFG, across a control and treatment group. You can access this data here:\n",
      "\n",
      "    >>> wget http://genomic.wustl.edu/bioinofrmatics/python/lessons/treatment.csv\n",
      "    >>> wget http://genomic.wustl.edu/bioinofrmatics/python/lessons/control.csv\n",
      "\n",
      "**Exercise:** Use the documentation for the [**ttest_ind**](http://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy-0.14.0/reference/generated/scipy.stats.ttest_ind.html) function to determine if the mean expression of YFG is significantly different between the control and treatment groups. Remember, T-test is a parametric distribution that assumes normality. Before you perform the t-test, test if the gene expression for YFG comes from a normal distribution. Use the [normaltest](http://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy-0.14.0/reference/generated/scipy.stats.mstats.normaltest.html) function, like we did in the example. \n",
      "\n",
      "**Bonus:** *ttest_ind* has a parameter called *equal_var* that is TRUE if the samples have equal variance and FALSE if not. What value should we use? You can use [Bartlett's test](http://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy-0.14.0/reference/generated/scipy.stats.bartlett.html#scipy.stats.bartlett) to determine which value we should use.\n",

      "**Hints:***\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Make sure the SciPy stats module is imported:\n",
      "\n",
      "        >>> from scipy import stats\n",
      "        \n",
      "2. Once you transfered the files using *wget*, import them to a NumPy array using the [`loadtxt`](http://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.loadtxt.html) function. **These are comma separated files with no header line.**\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "# Solution\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Import all necessary scientific python packages:\n",
      "\n",
      "        >>> import numpy as np\n",
      "        >>> import scipy as sp\n",
      "        >>> from scipy import stats\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Load the control and treatment data into numpy arrays:\n",
      "\n",
      "        >>> control = np.loadtxt(\"control.csv\", delimiter=\",\")\n",
      "        >>> treatment = np.loadtxt(\"treatment.csv\", delimiter=\",\")\n",

      "        \n",
      "    For both groups, P>0.05, so we fail to reject the null hypothesis that the sample comes from a normal distribution.\n",
      "    \n",
      "4. **BONUS:** Test for equal variances. Since we know each sample comes from a normal distribution, we can use [Bartlett's test](http://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy-0.14.0/reference/generated/scipy.stats.bartlett.html#scipy.stats.bartlett):\n",

      "        \n",
      "    P < 0.05, so we reject the null hypothesis that the control and treatment samples have equal variances. Let's remember this when we get ready to test for equal mean expression.\n",
