      "In our two lessons, we interacted with Python directly from the prompt (or the interpreter). Now, we will learn how to interact with Python in the way that you will most commonly interact: writing and executing scripts.\n",
      "\n",
      "Your first script, [as with many first time programmers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%22Hello,_world!%22_program), will be a simple script that prints \"Hello, world!\". \n",

      "First, create a file named \"hello_world.py\" with the following contents:\n",

      "\n",
      "1. The first line of every python script is always <code>#!/usr/bin/env python</code>. This allows the python inerpreter to be invoked. Thefore, if hello_world.py was marked as executable, we could omit invoking the python interpreter manually:\n",

      "\n",
      "3. In Python 2, print is a statement that prints everything on the same line to STDOUT. In Python 3, print is a function. So, in Python 3, we would need to write <code>print(\"Hello, world!\")</code> instead. We will continue to use Python 2 syntax, but we wanted you to be aware of the change.
