## TODO: read in each line of the input file, determine if the 
## line is a sequence name or a sequence.  If the line is a 
## sequence, trim off the first 14 bases and print the length of 
## the trimmed sequence to the screen.  Lastly, print the line 
## (either a sequence name or a trimmed sequence) to the output file.


## TODO: close the output file
