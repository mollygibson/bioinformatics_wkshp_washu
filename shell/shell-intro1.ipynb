      "### The file system\n",
      "The **file system** is the part of the operating system responsible for managing files and folders.  In Unix, folders are called **directories**.\n",
      "\n",
      "Unix keeps files arranged in a hierarchical structure. From the \u2018top-level\u2019 of the computer, there\n",
      "will be a number of directories, each of which can contain files and subdirectories, and each of\n",
      "those in turn can of course contain more files and subdirectories and so on, ad infinitum. It\u2019s\n",
      "important to note that you will always be \u201cin\u201d a directory when using the terminal. The default\n",
      "behavior is that when you open a new terminal you start in your own **home  directory**.  Your home directory contains files and subdirectories that only you can modify.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Printing the current working directory\n",
      "In this lesson, we'll be moving around the file system.  If you get lost, you can determine where you are by typing the command **`pwd`**:\n",
      "\n",
      "        $ pwd\n",

      "\n",
      "Let's disect what the output of `pwd` means: `pwd` returns the full filename of the current working directory.  Remember how the Unix file structure is arranged hierarchially?  `pwd` tells you where you are based on the topmost directory.  This topmost directory is called the `root directory`.  Therefore, the filename `/home/nrockweiler` means we're in a directory called `nrockweiler` which is in a directory called `home` which is in the root direcory.  Graphically, it looks like this:\n",

Notice that there was no output printed to the screen.  Instead, this command moved you to a new place on the file system.\n",

      "We can also use the `cd` command to change to other directories in the filesystem.  They sytax for running `cd` is:\n",

      "\n",
      "Let's make a directory called `temp` in our `shell_tutorial` directory.  First, change to `shell_tutorial` directory. To do this we will need to change to our home directory (`~`) and then change to the `shell_tutorial` directory.
