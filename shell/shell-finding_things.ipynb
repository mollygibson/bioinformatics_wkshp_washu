      "In this workshop, we'll be writing several Python scripts.  You're probably most familiar with writing documents in Microsoft Word/Pages/Google Docs/etc.  When we write a script, it's best to write it in a specialized program called a **text editor**.  There are [tons](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_text_editors) of text editors out there each with its own special set of bells and whistles.  For this workshop, we're going to use the text editor called **nano**.  While nano is pretty basic, it has the advantage that it's very easy to pick up.  When you become a more advanced coder, we recommend [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/) for Mac and Windows users.\n",

      "\n",
      "The title bar is displayed at the top of the editor.  On the lefthand side of the title bar, the version of `nano` is displayed.  The middle of title bar displays the current filename.  This is helpful when you forget what file you're editing.  The righthand side of title bar will be display the word \"Modified\" if the file has been changed since it was last open or saved.  Since we haven't changed the file, this part of the title bar is blank.\n",

      "To find specific files and directories, use the **`find`** command.  The syntax for `find` is:\n",

      "\n",
      "where `path_to_search` is the path you want to search in.  By default, it is the current working directory.  `criteria_for_searching` if how you want to filter the search results, e.g., filter for files that were modified today, etc.  By default, no filtering is done.  `what_to_do` is what you want to do with the search results, e.g., delete them (yikes!).  By default, the search results are printed.\n",

      "This `find` command searches recursively in the current working working directory for a thing called `english.txt` if it finds anything, it prints the filename.  In the output, you can see that the command found our file.  On close inspection, you can see a `./` at the beginning of the path.  The `./` is shorthand for the current working directory.  So, our file is located in a the `data` directory which is in the `shell_tutorial` directory which is in the current working directory.\n",
      "\n",
      "Next, let's find all `.txt` files.  We can do this with another powerful Unix feature called **wildcards**.  A wildcard is a character that stands for a class of characters in pattern matching.  The **`*` wildcard** matches zero or more characters.  This will hopefully make more sense with an example!\n",

      "In this section, we're going to combine the previous two sections to find specific text within our `find` searcg results.  Hold on your hats, it's about to get a little more complex!\n",

The latter part of the command `-exec grep \"o\" {} \\;` means execute the command `grep \"o\"` on each search result and return the output from that command.  The `{}` is used as a placeholder for the search result and the `\\;` denotes that the end of the command.\n",
